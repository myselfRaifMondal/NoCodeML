## üéØ Key Capabilities

### 1. Automatic Issue Detection & Resolution
```python
# Detects 10+ types of data quality issues
issues = preprocessor._comprehensive_data_assessment(df, target_column, problem_type)

# Automatically categorizes by severity and provides solutions
critical_issues = [i for i in issues if i.severity.value == 'critical']
for issue in critical_issues:
    print(f"{issue.description} - Solution: {issue.solution}")
```

### 2. Intelligent Missing Data Handling
```python
# Automatically chooses optimal strategy based on data characteristics
processed_df, result = preprocessor.comprehensive_preprocessing(
    df, target_column='target', problem_type=ProblemType.CLASSIFICATION
)

# Strategies include: Simple, KNN, Iterative, Forward Fill, Interpolation
print(f"Applied {len(result.transformations_applied)} transformations")
```

### 3. Iterative Improvement with Model Feedback
```python
# Uses model performance to guide preprocessing improvements
pipeline = EnhancedMLPipeline(learning_enabled=True)
results = await pipeline.train_with_iterative_improvement(
    df=df, target_column='target', problem_type=ProblemType.CLASSIFICATION,
    max_preprocessing_iterations=3, max_training_iterations=3
)
```

### 4. Learning from User Feedback
```python
# Learns from user satisfaction to improve future preprocessing
feedback = {
    'overall_satisfaction': 8,
    'preprocessing_satisfaction': 9,
    'comments': 'Excellent missing data handling',
    'suggestions': ['more_conservative_outlier_removal']
}
preprocessor._learn_from_feedback(feedback, result)
```

### 5. Comprehensive Reporting
```python
# Generates detailed reports with actionable insights
report = preprocessor.generate_improvement_report(results)
print(f"Quality improvement: {report['executive_summary']['total_quality_improvement']}%")
print(f"Issues resolved: {report['issue_analysis']['auto_fixed_count']}")
```
