## üìã Step-by-Step User Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Data üìÇ

1. Click on **"üìÇ Data Upload"** in the sidebar
2. Choose your CSV or Excel file using the file uploader
3. Preview your data in the table that appears
4. Click **"üöÄ Analyze This Dataset"** to process your data

**Supported File Types:**
- CSV files (`.csv`)
- Excel files (`.xlsx`, `.xls`)

**Tips for Best Results:**
- Ensure your data has clear column headers
- Remove obviously incorrect values (negative ages, impossible dates, etc.)
- Keep file size under 200MB for faster processing
- Have at least 50-100 rows of data (500+ is better)

### Step 2: Explore Your Data üìä

1. Go to **"üìä Data Analysis"** after uploading your data
2. Review the **Dataset Overview** metrics:
   - **Total Rows**: Number of data points
   - **Total Columns**: Number of features
   - **Quality Score**: Overall data quality (higher is better)
   - **Missing Data**: Percentage of missing values

3. Examine the **Column Details** table to understand each feature
4. Explore visualizations in three tabs:
   - **üìä Distributions**: See how your data is spread
   - **üîó Correlations**: Find relationships between numeric features
   - **‚ùì Missing Data**: Identify where data is missing

5. Read the **üí° Suggestions** and **‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings** for data quality tips

### Step 3: Build Your Model ü§ñ

1. Navigate to **"ü§ñ Model Building"**
2. **Define Your Problem:**
   - Choose **Classification** for predicting categories (Yes/No, Good/Bad/Excellent)
   - Choose **Regression** for predicting numbers (price, temperature, age)

3. **Select Your Target Variable:**
   - This is what you want to predict
   - Example: "price" for house price prediction, "churn" for customer retention

4. **Choose Features:**
   - Select which columns the model should use to make predictions
   - More relevant features usually mean better predictions
   - The system pre-selects reasonable defaults

5. **Configure Model Settings:**
   - **Test set size**: How much data to save for testing (20% is recommended)
   - **Auto-tuning**: Let the system find the best settings automatically

6. Click **"üöÄ Build Model"** and wait for training to complete

### Step 4: Use Your Model üìà

1. Go to **"üìà Results & Export"** to see your trained model
2. Review the **Model Performance:**
   - **Classification**: Look for accuracy > 70%
   - **Regression**: Look for R¬≤ score > 0.7

3. Check **Feature Importance** to see which features matter most
4. **Make Predictions** with new data:
   - Enter values for each feature
   - Click **"üéØ Make Prediction"** to get results

## üéØ Example Workflows

### Example 1: Predicting House Prices (Regression)
1. **Upload**: CSV with columns like `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `square_feet`, `price`
2. **Analyze**: Check data quality and distributions
3. **Model**: Choose "Regression", select `price` as target, use other columns as features
4. **Results**: Look for R¬≤ score > 0.7, make predictions for new houses

### Example 2: Customer Churn Prediction (Classification)
1. **Upload**: Customer data with `age`, `monthly_bill`, `complaints`, `churn_status`
2. **Analyze**: Look for patterns in churned vs. retained customers
3. **Model**: Choose "Classification", select `churn_status` as target
4. **Results**: Aim for accuracy > 75%, predict churn for new customers

### Example 3: Product Quality Assessment (Classification)
1. **Upload**: Manufacturing data with measurements and `quality_grade`
2. **Analyze**: Check which measurements correlate with quality
3. **Model**: Choose "Classification", select `quality_grade` as target
4. **Results**: Use model to predict quality of new products

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if my data has missing values?**
A: The system will detect and warn you. You can still build models, but consider cleaning your data first for better results.

**Q: How do I know if my model is good?**
A: 
- **Classification**: Accuracy > 70% is decent, > 85% is very good
- **Regression**: R¬≤ score > 0.7 is good, > 0.9 is excellent

**Q: Can I use categorical data (text)?**
A: Yes! The system automatically handles text categories by converting them to numbers.

**Q: What if I get low accuracy?**
A: Try:
- Adding more relevant features
- Collecting more data
- Cleaning your data (remove outliers, fix missing values)
- Checking if your problem is well-defined

**Q: How much data do I need?**
A: Minimum 50-100 rows, but 500+ rows typically give much better results.

**Q: Can I save my model?**
A: Currently, models are saved in your browser session. Export functionality for permanent storage is coming soon!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Problem**: "No dataset analyzed yet" message
**Solution**: Go to "Data Upload" first and analyze a dataset

**Problem**: Low model accuracy
**Solutions**:
- Check data quality in the Analysis section
- Ensure you have enough data (500+ rows recommended)
- Verify your target variable is correctly defined
- Remove irrelevant features

**Problem**: File upload fails
**Solutions**:
- Check file format (CSV or Excel only)
- Ensure file size is under 200MB
- Verify data has proper column headers

**Problem**: Missing value warnings
**Solutions**:
- Clean your data before uploading
- Remove rows with too many missing values
- Fill missing values with appropriate defaults

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Data Quality Matters Most**
   - Clean, relevant data beats complex models
   - Remove obvious errors and outliers
   - Ensure consistent data formats

2. **Feature Selection**
   - Include features that logically relate to your target
   - More isn't always better - focus on relevant features
   - Remove highly correlated duplicate features

3. **Understanding Your Problem**
   - Clearly define what you want to predict
   - Ensure your target variable is meaningful
   - Consider if machine learning is the right approach

4. **Interpreting Results**
   - Don't just look at accuracy - understand what it means
   - Check feature importance to understand your model
   - Test predictions with known examples

5. **Iterative Improvement**
   - Start simple, then refine
   - Try different feature combinations
   - Collect more data if results aren't satisfactory
